                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Shon Boothe and I was founded back in the year 2000. I am now a senior at the University of Oklahoma studying Management of Information Systems (MIS). While my degree is in the computer field, I am more invoved in the banking world. I am currently a bank examiner for the U.S. Treasury and recvieved this job through an internship in 2021.</p>
                <p>Personally, I have a beautiful wife and a great dane named Snoopy. He likes to play and sleep and his favorite activity is to go on a walk. We, as a family, like to travel and dream to go around the world.</p>
                <p>I love sports and am an avid Texas Rangers, Cinncinati Bengals, Oklahoma City Thunder, and of course a Oklahoma Sooners fan! Sports is what keeps me and my wife going throughout the week. Football is our absolute favorite with baseball being a close second. I played college baseball for multiple years and still enjoy the strategy. One of my many skils is that I can name every Division One NCAA college mascot.</p>

                <h2>Projects</h2>
                <p>Through college, I haven't finished an extensive amount of project work. However, I have a few things to highlight.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Database project (Junior year of college). Through this class I learned how to not only use databases but also build them.</li>
                    <li>Multiple coding assignments using html, css, wpf applications, and MVC. Through programming in college I gained a strong knowledge how to write code using C#.</li>
                    <li>Capstone project. My Last class in college gave me a great knowledge of business strategy while I had to do a 20 page essay along with a prentaion on why General Eletric has a bad business model.</li>
